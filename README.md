# Smart Protection Frontend challenge

Welcome to Star Wars universe!

We made a simple web-app that lists the different planest of the star wars universe. To achieve that, we are using the Star-Wars API (https://swapi.dev/). Please feel free to watch the documentation.

We were in a hurry when we made this project, that's why our code is not very good. We would like to receive some help from you to improve it and have the coolest code.

## Please see the following points where we think we need to improve:

- The app should handle the different states of the app (loading, success, error).

- We want to create the planet detail view, which allows the user to access to this detail from the planet list (you can use a new route). The planet detail should be simple (for instance, "hello tatooine")

- Refactor code to decouple logic from the components (components should be stateless). It could be interesting to avoid code leaks (unnecessary rerender, for example).

- Improve the project architecture to decouple the business logic from the views (you can use your favorite architecture. Using Domain Drive Design is a bonus point ðŸ˜‰)

- Improve the typing used in the app (the `any` types makes jesus cry)

## Bonus points:

- Testing

- Improve the state management using APIContexts.

You can make the points in any order.
